# NetworkSecurityModel
Build and implement the best predictive machine learning model. Main objective is to Classify Network Security Attacks with best accuracy and in fastest time.


We have tried to deploy two model for our 

And evaluation will be done based on 4 metrics(Testing score,Training score, Testing Time and Training Time) and the best model will be selected. It should be having highest accuracy and quickest time in training & testing.

Two models are being deployed binary and multi-class classification model
